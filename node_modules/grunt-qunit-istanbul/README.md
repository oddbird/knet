# grunt-qunit-istanbul
> Run QUnit unit tests in a headless PhantomJS instance withn code coverage analysis provided by istanbul.

# IMPORTANT
This is a fork of the grunt-contrib-qunit repo.
I added the ability to generate [istanbul](http://gotwarlost.github.com/istanbul/) based test coverage reports.
Unfortunately this couldn' be handled as a seperate plugin, because we need to hook in
deeper into grunt-contrib-qunit & grunt-lib-phantomjs structure :(

This plugin should work as a drop in replacement for your current `qunit` task,
for any further configuration, please check out the original plugins repo


## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-qunit-istanbul --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-qunit-istanbul');
```

## Qunit task
_Run this task with the `grunt qunit` command._

Task targets, files and options may be specified according to the grunt [Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide.

When installed by npm, this plugin will automatically download and install [PhantomJS][] locally via the [grunt-lib-phantomjs-istanbul][] library.

[PhantomJS]: http://www.phantomjs.org/
[grunt-lib-phantomjs-istanbul]: https://github.com/asciidisco/grunt-lib-phantomjs-istanbul
