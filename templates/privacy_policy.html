  </p>

  <p>
    The K Network may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements to the Sites.

They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see. The K Network does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks The K Network to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, purchasers of educational goods), and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Site(s), such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you. Please review the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices.
