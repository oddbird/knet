  <h1 class="section-title">What we offer</h1>
  <div class="what-block">
    <h2 class="block-title">Personalized Learning</h2>
    <p>
      Introduce teachers to digital tools
      that generate data on each student
      so that teachers can be more responsive to student needs
      and can easily personalize lessons for all students.

  <div class="what-block">
    <h2 class="block-title">Khan Academy Integration</h2>
    <p>
      Work with schools and teachers
      to implement Khan Academy in classrooms
      efficiently and for maximum results.
      Preliminary data shows
      that when adopted effectively and in its entirety,
      students’ understanding can improve
      so much that they work up to three years ahead
      of their grade level.

  <div class="what-block">
    <h2 class="block-title">The “Flipped Classroom”</h2>
    <p>
      Help teachers to transfer the classroom lecture
      to the student’s home after class,
      freeing up classroom time for problem solving and project creation.
      This allows teachers to increase the time they can spend
      1-on-1 and in small groups with students.
